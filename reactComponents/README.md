// customActions is the array list which has the index and component
const customActions = [
    {
        index: 1,
        component: actionComponent1
    },
    {    
        index: 2,
        component: actionComponent2   
    },
    {   
        index: 3,
        component: actionComponent3
    },
    ...
]

// You can refer the detail for the token pair information from the prop
const actionComponent1 = (props) => {  
  const {detail} = props
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Exchange: ', detail)
  }
  return (
    <div onClick={handleClick}>Exchange</div>
  )
}
```
